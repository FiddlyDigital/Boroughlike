## Story
An experiment in the Grand Wizard's extensive Tower has gone horribly wrong!
Creatures in books have been brought to life, causing havoc.

The Grand Wizard was able to neutralize the majority of the creatures, turning them back into their books.
Now is your chance to escape! Race to the bottom of the Tower, collecting as many magic books as possible along the way.

Bump into enemies to weaken them and turn them back into book form. Beware though; the Monsters will bump back!
